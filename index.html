        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>By, Choosing a course of study is a critical decision that can shape a student's future. Many students face difficulties in selecting a course that aligns with their interests, abilities, and career aspirations. One of the primary challenges that students face is the various number of online courses available. Students may find it difficult to evaluate each course's suitability and identify the one that suits them best. Additionally, social pressure and parental expectations may influence a student's decision, leading them to choose a course that they may not enjoy or excel at.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this project is to develop a website that provides personalised course recommendations for students based on their academic performance and interests. The website aims to help students make informed decisions about their education and career by analysing data on student’s performances. The project involves developing a course recommendation engine that uses machine learning algorithms to match students with suitable courses based on their performance data.

        <h3>AI & ML :</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and language understanding. AI algorithms are designed to learn from data and improve over time, allowing machines to identify patterns and make predictions with increasing accuracy. AI has many applications across various industries and has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but also presents ethical and social challenges.<br>
        Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing computer algorithms that can automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning is to create predictive models that can identify patterns and make accurate predictions or decisions based on input data. There are several types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Machine learning has many practical applications, such as speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.<br><br>

        <h3>CYBERSECURITY :</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, theft, damage, or disruption. It involves the use of technologies, processes, and practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets. Cybersecurity threats can come from various sources, including cybercriminals, hackers, viruses, malware, and insiders. Cybersecurity measures include network security, data encryption, access controls, identity and access management, incident response, and disaster recovery. Effective cybersecurity is essential to protect organizations and individuals from cyber threats and maintain the trust and integrity of digital systems.<br><br></p>


        <h3>WEB DEV :</h3>
        <p>Full stack web development involves the development of web applications that include both front-end and back-end components, as well as the underlying database and infrastructure. Full stack developers are proficient in multiple programming languages and frameworks, and are capable of developing, testing, and deploying entire web applications from end-to-end. Full stack web development is a critical skill set in modern web development and is in high demand by businesses and organizations looking to develop sophisticated and scalable web applications.<br><br></p>


        <h3>APP DEV :</h3>
        <p>App development is the process of creating software applications that run on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. App developers use programming languages such as Java, Swift, or Kotlin to build native apps for specific mobile operating systems like iOS or Android, or cross-platform apps that can run on multiple operating systems. App development involves various stages, including planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. App developers also need to consider user experience, security, and performance optimization in their work. Mobile apps have become an essential part of modern life, and app development is a critical skill set in the tech industry.<br><br></p>
