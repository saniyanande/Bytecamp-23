# Bytecamp-23
**Overview:** A course recommendation system is an algorithm that suggests courses to students based on their
interests, academic background, and other relevant factors.To build a course recommendation system, we need to collect data about students and courses, such as their academic history, grades, interests, and course content.

**Proposed Solution:** The purpose of this project is to develop website that provides personalized course
recommendations for students based on their academic performance and interests.The website aims to help students make informed decisions about their education and career by analysing data on students performances.

**System requirements:** HTML, CSS and Java Script.
Python with Machine Learning Libraries and Frameworks like Pandas, Matplotlib,
Numpy etc.
Github is used for collaborate working and deploying the project.
Netlify is used for hosting the website on the server.

**Results: **The result of the system leads to the pdf generation of the students test marks and based on that courses are recommended to them.

**Future Scope: **In addition to academic history and course content, future course recommendation systems could also take into account data from social media, extracurricular activities, and other sources to generate more accurate recommendations.
